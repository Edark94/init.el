* The Plan
  It will be multiple parts.
  1. Research and write about it
     This will require I find papers to give me an idea
     of what algorithm I should use and why I use it. 
     I will need to justify it in regards to time and 
     performance.
  2. Implementation
     I will try and make the code and improve the product
     This will require me to have one of these machines 
     and change part of the source code thats written in 
     c++. 
  3. Conclusion
     I will need to compare and measure the finished product
     with the old one. I will need to make graphs

  4. Finish
     I will need to write multiple drafts and send them in
     after its been reviewd thoroughly.

** Text...
   The plan would be to link a few papers, use given data
   and try to pick which colour space would fit the 
   best and use a thresholding method. 
   That would be the fastest and easiest way to
   determine if there is any red or not. The following
   colour spaces are the interesting ones.
   + Lab
   + HSV
   + BGR

   Laplacian filter är snabbt och enkelt, kan använda
   vissa skrifter som jämfört som underlag för detta
   per första länken. Koden finns där och är ganska
   lätt att implementera.

   By simply utilizing the underlying hardware we can
   get a big increase of performance. Whether or not they use
   it is not known.
